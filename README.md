## Cars JS Application

Play with cars. Make it go fast. Avoid obstacles and boundaries.

### Installation

Simply clone the repo and visit `cars.html` in your browser (works in all modern
major browsers).

### TODOs

1. Refactor in object-oriented fashion to enable several cars
2. Add sensors at the front of the cars to detect distance from obstacles
3. Try to ML it!
